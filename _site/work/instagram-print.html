  <li><strong>Project:</strong> Mobile App Prototype for <a href="https://twitter.com/ga">@GENERAL ASSEMBLY</a></li>
  <li><strong>Role:</strong> UX Designer • Prototyper</li>
  <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2 Weeks • 3 Designers • July 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>Instagram Print was a project for General Assembly’s UXDI class in partnership with Paz Perez and Christina Vu. In the brief, Instagram needed a way to diversify their revenue stream, requiring a new printing feature directly integrated into the social network.</p>

<p>The team for this project was really tight-knit, and the process was a big exercise in participatory design, from user research to prototyping.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the project, my role shifted to assembling the app prototype using Axure, which you can play around with using  <a href="http://y9d00x.axshare.com/#c=2" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>

<h4 id="finding-our-starting-point">Finding our starting point</h4>

<p>We set our core concept as an expansion of Instagram’s brand into the real world by connecting Instagram into the old way of sharing — through printing and gifting pictures.</p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<h4 id="competitive-analysis-user-research-and-affinity-mapping">Competitive analysis, User Research and Affinity Mapping</h4>

<p>We started the research phase by sending out a survey that, combined with several rounds of user interviews, allowed us to understand the users’ photo printing needs and Instagram usage habits.</p>

<p>The competitive research was extremely valuable, as it showed pain-points of competitors, and also highlighted one of our main value propositions: being able to print your friends’ pictures.</p>

<p>Research results were aggregated in an affinity map, to prioritize user needs and features, which was then used to build three personas for the project.</p>

<h4 id="storyboarding-and-user-flows">Storyboarding and User Flows</h4>

<p>A quick storyboarding session helped to shape the first user flows, that made clear how the user would move through the new feature in order to print pictures.</p>

<p>The flows were complemented by an overview of the new feature in comparison to the rest of app’s architecture.</p>

<h3 id="interaction-design">Interaction Design</h3>

<h4 id="sketching-testing-prototyping-testing">Sketching, Testing, Prototyping, Testing</h4>

<p>Early sketches were done in group on the whiteboard, as a way to get the team on the same page and define initial expectations for the interface.</p>

<p>These were followed by several batches of rough wireframes that solidified the idea we had for the interface and allowed us to move forward to user testing.</p>

</section>
<p><img src="/v2/assets/img/interaction_design_3.png" alt="Paper Prototyping" /></p>

<p>Doing tests with paper prototypes allowed us to sketch, test and incorporate feedback much faster than going straight to digital.</p>

<p>Product selection and checkout screens were specially challenging, interface-wise: our first version had too much information density, while further down the road we over-simplified. Only through several iterations and a lot of testing we found the right balance.</p>

<p><img src="/v2/assets/img/interaction_design_4.png" alt="User Testing" /></p>

<p>When we were ready to move forward, the team finished the final mockups, while I prepared the interactive prototype using Axure – which included mimicking some of Instagram’s native interactions, as pictured below.</p>

<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>

<h4 id="design-at-close-quarters">Design at close quarters</h4>

<p>The deadline was tough, but the close-knit teamwork and the test-driven approach enabled us to achieve great results in a short ammount of time.</p>

<p>Loads of testing allowed us to constantly fix our assumptions, while having the team in sync meant better feedback — and thus, a better design output.</p>
