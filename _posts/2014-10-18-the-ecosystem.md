Apple's value ever since its Renaissance has relied on a tightly integrated Ecosystem.

The iPod wouldn't have been a phenomenon without the iTunes Store. The iPad wouldn't have sold as much as it did without the iPhone and their shared apps and services. And now OSX is getting closer than ever to iOS with the release of Yosemite.

However, Apple's revenue model is still mainly based on their Hardware. Sure, by now it's impossible to consider the iPhone without iOS in mind, and the OS deserves much of the praise for the success of Apple has had in the last few years.

Still, when you have to develop and improve:

 - OSX
 - iOS
 - iTunes
 - iTunes (the Store)
 - iTunes (the Radio)
 - Appstore (for iOS)
 - Appstore (for OSX)
 - Safari (for both)
 - iCloud
 - iBooks
 - Newsstand
 - Game Center
 - iLife
 - iWork
 - Apple Health
 - Final Cut Pro
 - Logic Pro
 - A brand new programming language
 - and a _miniaturized wrist watch Computer_...

it's a lot to juggle. At US$ 170 billion revenue and 98,000 employees, one has to wonder how much more can Apple grow without wearing itself thin even further.

<h3>Let's face it: a bunch of Apple apps suck</h3>

That's not hard to demonstrate. Just grab someone's iPhone to see the apps on their homescreen. Are they using Mail or Gmail? iTunes Radio or Spotify? iCloud or Dropbox?

Truth be told, Apple's goal it not to make you use every single default app the ships with iOS. But use enough Google products on your iPhone, and you suddenly aren't as commited to their ecosystem lock-in as they wish you were.

That's the reason setting secondary defaults will hardly ever happen, as it directly undermines Apple's business strategy by devaluing their ecosystem. Sure, [they've added Extensions](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/explaining-ios-8s-extensions-opening-the-platform-while-keeping-it-secure/), but their cautious approach shows how little they are willing to concede in their dominance. In light of _The Default Apps_, the massive usage Mail.app gets is not so different from the one IE used to have long ago.

<h3><em>Boo hoo</em>, Mom insists on using these terrible apps!</h3>

If only. Far from being a "bad app" problem, this is a system-wide issue that affects Apple and their relations with content producers and developers.

Newsstand, the platform that was supposed to showcase the iPad's power and might, is crumbling: not only its "killer app" [died eons ago](http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/3/3721544/the-daily-ipad-news-mag-shutdown-december-15th), but their indie darling [is closing doors as well](http://www.cultofmac.com/299139/9-hard-lessons-top-ipad-publisher/). 

Meanwhile, the Appstore is overrun by clones of popular apps like a horde of Orcs climbing the castle walls — and iOS development is [no](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93118460565/a-candid-look-at-unreads-first-year) [longer](http://inessential.com/2014/07/28/more_on_ios_indies) [as](http://www.tuaw.com/2014/07/30/the-plight-of-the-indie-ios-developer-is-the-app-store-broken-o/) [sustainable](http://inessential.com/2014/07/28/more_on_ios_indies) as it once was. 

Sure, maybe the market is changing. But it may also be that the App Store information architecture and discoverability are bad enough to jeopardize all the work done by Apple and iOS Developers in the past 6 years.

<h3>"Maybe Apple should buy Twitter"</h3>

This odd, yet fairly sensible [argument from 2012](http://patrickbgibson.com/post/36041799210/apple-and-twitter) still holds ground today, in the sense that Apple is still _not_ a Web Services company.

From the smoldering failure that was MobileMe rose [a headache called iCloud](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/26/4148628/why-doesnt-icloud-just-work) — one that just culminated in what may be Apple's biggest PR fiasco of all time.

Apple Maps? Tim Cook issued a public apology and [fired](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/apple-fires-maps-manager/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0) the manager responsible for it.

And Siri, the service that was released in iOS with a Beta tag is... well, is just [not there yet](http://dcurt.is/voice-interfaces). Maybe they should've kept the Beta tag.

<h3>It's a hard job</h3>

Mantaining such a wide ecosystem of apps and web services is a task that no one else carries out as well as Apple, hence their dominance of the mobile and tablet market. 

Still, their hardware release schedule is [pushing the limits](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2014/10/11/apples-software-quality-decline/) of how fast they can improve their software ecosystem, and no ammount of extra engineers and designers will be able to fix this conundrum — I mean, when you get to 100,000 employees adding more to your ranks might just get in the way.

Perhaps it's time for iOS and Apple to get back to basics.
