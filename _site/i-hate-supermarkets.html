    <h2><span class="break comma">A quick redesign of a terrible shopping experience</span>by Daniel Fosco</h2>
<hr />

<h3 id="a-hatehate-relationship">A Hate/Hate relationship</h3>

<p>I hate supermarkets. In their current state, they’re a prime example of lost opportunities for innovation and, most importantly, of time waste for both customers and companies.</p>

<p>They’re ineficcient — and that’s not even comparing them with online grocery shopping, which is better, but yet another wasteland of good opportunities<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Let’s review the steps necessary to successfully buy groceries, once you’re at the supermarket:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get a shopping cart</li>
  <li>Put stuff in shopping cart</li>
  <li>Put stuff in the checkout tray</li>
  <li>Put stuff in bags</li>
  <li>Put bags in shopping cart</li>
  <li>Put bags in your car</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds too much? That’s because it is. And I’m not even talking about lines. But now we have the technology to do better.</p>

<h3 id="express-checkout">Express Checkout</h3>

<p>This process is downright unacceptable. You might as well travel back in time to the Middle Ages if you’re into this kind of dark stuff.</p>

<p>The answer for this contemporary dark age are RFID tags. They’re already on your public transport card and in the stuff the Supermarket <em>really</em> doesn’t want you to steal, like DVDs and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/why-are-criminals-stealing-tide-detergent-and-using-it-for-money/254631/">Tide</a>. </p>

<p>Once you have them in your products, half of the problem is gone — grab the thing, go out the door. Charge my credit card later, thank you. For those that still don’t get it, watch this hip <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eob532iEpqk">IBM concept video</a>. It’s from 2006.</p>

<p>Over 10 years ago the RFID Journal was announcing <a href="http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?363">1-cent tags</a>. The price still haven’t dropped below 10 cents, which makes it too expensive to implement in large scale, and is the alleged reason supermarkets still keep us in the dark ages.</p>

<p>But you know what? They don’t have to implement it in large scale. If people want expensive infrastructure that makes their life better, just make them pay for it.</p>

<h3 id="a-supermarket-within-a-supermarket">A Supermarket within a Supermarket</h3>

<p>Certainly, the problem of widely implementing RFID tags in retail is affected by logistics, as much as it’s by cost. How do you allow people to leave the supermarket with a product that doesn’t have to go through the cashier? What if they pocket that candy bar that doesn’t have the damn tag<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>?</p>

<p>This is why it has to be done in <em>levels</em>.</p>

<p>The solution is to have a supermarket inside a supermarket. A closed off section with a small sample of every product, properly tagged, that allows the customer to do an express checkout, similar to a monthly-pass on a highway toll. Of course, there’s also a subscription price for all of this convenience.</p>

###The Bane of Shopping Carts</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fhCRUpO.png" alt="Definitely cousins" />
<small>Definitely cousins</small></p>

<p>So you’ve left the supermarket without taking any lines or having to move the products from the cart. You walk to your car. And then you realize you still need to bag the things you just bought. Ugh.</p>

<p>You’re part of the problem shopping cart. Time to become part of the solution.</p>

<p>The idea is for the cart to become a skeleton for a modular set of boxes, that are used to store products inside the market and in the way home. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iskW4hI.png" alt="Modular Shopping Cart  alt=&quot;Modular Shopping Cart&quot;" />
<small>A modular, take-away shopping cart</small><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>When you return the next time, bring back the boxes. Or don’t — if you want to take 20 of them home you can, but your credit card will be charged.</p>

<p>Ideally, the “boxes” would be made out of a semi-hard silicon material that fits the format of the cart, but bend to double as bags on the way home.</p>

<h3 id="now-were-talking">Now we’re talking!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Get a shopping cart</li>
  <li>Put stuff in shopping cart</li>
  <li><span class="strike">Put stuff in the checkout tray</span></li>
  <li><span class="strike">Put stuff in bags</span></li>
  <li><span class="strike">Put bags in shopping cart</span></li>
  <li>Put <span class="strike">bags</span> high-tech boxes in your car</li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a sketch of what a different grocery shopping experience could become, and undoubtedly, people in the industry with decades of experience on the subject are working on solutions like this right now.</p>

<p>Still, I hope it contributes to further drive the discussion on the future of physical retail and make people realize how much better <em>and faster</em> their afternoon at the supermarket could be.</p>
