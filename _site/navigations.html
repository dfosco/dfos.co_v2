    <h2><span class="break comma">A brief report on website navigation systems</span>by Daniel Fosco</h2>
<hr />

<h3 id="airbnb">AirBnB</h3>

<p>AirBnB offers a satisfactory navigation experience that caters to the different travelling preferences of their users. Selected cities have Neighborhood guides, allowing users to choose from a range of different characteristics for their place of stay.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nLKTOSv.png" alt="The different kinds of experiences offered by AirBnB in NYC" /></p>

<p>The website makes a good job in taking the user through different layers of navigation, progressively disclosing information in a way that’s not overwhelming — e.g. you can choose a <em>trendy</em> neighborhood, but not a <em>trendy</em> neighborhood in a <em>trendy</em> city, because frankly, that could get pretty confusing.</p>

<p>Along the way, the site presents fine-crafted descriptions and photographs about the selected neighborhood, as well as Hosts’ testimonials: all aiming to inform the user, increase trust and boost conversions.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/k7n8Ied.png" alt="Navigation Flow in AirBnB website" /></p>

<p>The listings page provides a useful map on the left with pins for each of the listings on the right and additional filters to narrow down your search. </p>

<p>It even highlights the marker on the map according to the listing you’re currently hovering — so the user can quickly assess the location and distance between each other.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7hdnaCK.png" alt="Listings Page" /></p>

<p>However, it does have some problems. For users that need to sort through a lot of listings, the page doesn’t show all of the available places in a given area — at the same time, it repeats listings when you scroll down too far on the page!</p>

<p>The page also brings up some listings that don’t have availability for the time-frame specified by the user. </p>

<p>It would also be nice to filter the list by places where you <em>already</em> contacted the host or already added to a Wishlist, speeding the process of sorting through listings.</p>

<p>All in all, it’s a good navigation experience, clearly designed with user needs in mind, and although it doesn’t fit the needs of all types of users, that’s never realistically expected.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="amazon">Amazon</h3>

<p>If there’s one thing to be said about Amazon, is that they’re <em>straightforward</em>. Even with a catalogue of gazillions of products, looking for a particular item is a matter of going down the levels in its aisles. </p>

<p>Here we’re browsing after the book “The Elements of User Experience”.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j0C6gGK.png" alt="Browsing after The Elements of User Experience" /></p>

<p>A few categories and 3 pages later… <em>voilà</em></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DoUrq8d.png" alt="The Elements of User Experience" /></p>

<p>It’s not a pretty experience, but it works, and it’s complemented by Amazons’ search and recommendation engines that help unearth the most relevant products you might need.</p>

<p>The most important takeaway is that Amazon is not afraid of showing you as much information as possible and then coming up with ways to improve the navigation. With a storefront of that size, it’s hard to see how they could use any other strategy.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="ibook-store">iBook Store</h3>

<p>Where Amazon primes for abundancy of information, Apple shines in its shortage.</p>

<p>The catalogue at its iBook Store is an assortment of single-level category pages that lead to generic and limited product lists.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/j0C6gGK.png" alt="Browsing the iBook Store" /></p>

<p>They do offer curated sub-categories, like the one above on Design, but there’s no way to see a full list of the titles inside. </p>

<p>Any product list only go as far as <em>100</em> titles, organized by “All-time Best Sellers” or alphabetic order — which, When organized A-Z, caps the list at the letter “A”. I’m not even joking.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qBaT9jr.png" alt="No longer browsing the iBook Store" /></p>

<p>In the end, the only way to find <em>The Elements of User Experience</em> on the iBook Store was to use the search function. They offer a good selection of titles on UX, but there’s absolutely no way to find it without actively searching for it. Combined with the lack of a recommendation engine, it’s no wonder Amazon’s ahead on the ebook game.</p>
