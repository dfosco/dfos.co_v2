<h2><span class="break comma">A brief report on website navigation systems</span>by Daniel Fosco</h2>

###AirBnB

AirBnB offers a satisfactory navigation experience that caters to the different travelling preferences of their users. Selected cities have Neighborhood guides, allowing users to choose from a range of different characteristics for their place of stay.

The website makes a good job in taking the user through different layers of navigation, progressively disclosing information in a way that's not overwhelming — e.g. you can choose a *trendy* neighborhood, but not a *trendy* neighborhood in a *trendy* city, because frankly, that could get pretty confusing.

Along the way, the site presents fine-crafted descriptions and photographs about the selected neighborhood, as well as Hosts' testimonials: all aiming to inform the user, increase trust and boost conversions.

The listings page provides a useful map on the left with pins for each of the listings on the right and additional filters to narrow down your search. 


It even highlights the marker on the map according to the listing you're currently hovering — so the user can quickly assess the location and distance between each other.

However, it does have some problems. For users that need to sort through a lot of listings, the page doesn't show all of the available places in a given area — at the same time, it repeats listings when you scroll down too far on the page!

The page also brings up some listings that don't have availability for the time-frame specified by the user. 

It would also be nice to filter the list by places where you *already* contacted the host or already added to a Wishlist, speeding the process of sorting through listings.

All in all, it's a good navigation experience, clearly designed with user needs in mind, and although it doesn't fit the needs of all types of users, that's never realistically expected.

###Amazon

If there's one thing to be said about Amazon, is that they're *straightforward*. Even with a catalogue of gazillions of products, looking for a particular item is a matter of going down the levels in its aisles. 

Here we're browsing after the book "The Elements of User Experience".

A few categories and 3 pages later... *voilà*

It's not a pretty experience, but it works, and it's complemented by Amazons' search and recommendation engines that help unearth the most relevant products you might need.

The most important takeaway is that Amazon is not afraid of showing you as much information as possible and then coming up with ways to improve the navigation. With a storefront of that size, it's hard to see how they could use any other strategy.

###iBook Store

Where Amazon primes for abundancy of information, Apple shines in its shortage.


The catalogue at its iBook Store is an assortment of single-level category pages that lead to generic and limited product lists.

They do offer curated sub-categories, like the one above on Design, but there's no way to see a full list of the titles inside. 


Any product list only go as far as *100* titles, organized by "All-time Best Sellers" or alphabetic order — which, When organized A-Z, caps the list at the letter "A". I'm not even joking.

In the end, the only way to find *The Elements of User Experience* on the iBook Store was to use the search function. They offer a good selection of titles on UX, but there's absolutely no way to find it without actively searching for it. Combined with the lack of a recommendation engine, it's no wonder Amazon's ahead on the ebook game.
